connected componenets are the nodes connected in a graph

strongly connected components are two nodes that are bi-directional or that are connected in suck a way that you can go back to the original node.

2) reverse the edges of the graph
3) bake a stack depending on the connections of the graph
4) use the elements of the stack to look at the graph and use that to find the strongly connected components
